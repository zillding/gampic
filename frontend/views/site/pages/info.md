#####Notes:

The "hover" event in jquery doesn't work?? how???!!

Should consider using OOP in javascript.
The current implementation has some flaws.

the "viewport" in the jquery waypoint means the top of the windew!!!

finally fix the performance issue.
use "height" attribute on the "img" is useless.
in order to reserver space for an image, has to adjust the css of the container of the image
